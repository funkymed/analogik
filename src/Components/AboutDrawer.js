        <p>
          <u>Analogik</u> stood as a beacon in the realm of Chiptune, a label
          where every artist was a luminary within the vibrant Demoscene of the
          2000s.
        </p>

        <p>
          Conceived by the visionary minds of <b>KenÃ«t</b> and <b>Med</b> in
          2000, <u>Analogik</u> was born from a simple yet audacious mission: to
          craft miniature masterpieces brimming with unparalleled composition
          and sonic brilliance.
        </p>

        <p>
          Among the founding members, <b>Nagz</b> shone brightly, contributing
          significantly to the label's ethos and churning out a plethora of
          tracks throughout its illustrious three-year tenure.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over the course of those three years, <u>Analogik</u> served as a
          melting pot of musical talent, attracting 27 artists from across the
          globe, representing {countries.length} countries. Together, they
          delved into an eclectic array of genres, spanning from jazz to
          chiptune, from hip-hop to funk, and from acid jazz to dark ambient and
          trip-hop. These musical marvels were meticulously composed using
          Impulse Tracker, ScreamTracker 3, and Fasttracker 2, with file sizes
          always kept under 80ko, often resting comfortably below 20ko.
        </p>

        <p>
          Hailing from diverse corners of the world : {countries.join(", ")}.
          The artists united under <u>Analogik</u>'s banner, forming a global
          symphony of creativity and collaboration.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the era before social media dominance, communication flourished
          through the digital underground of IRC channels, where artists
          connected and forged lasting bonds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Coded by Med in 2024 with the support of <b>Nagz</b>, <i>Willbe</i>,{" "}
          <u>Bacter</u>, <b>Unware</b> and <i>Ks</i>, this Music Disk is a gift
          for all the Chiptune's lovers to never forgot what was Analogik.
